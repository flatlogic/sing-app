Building a project from scratch means that there is a lot of things to keep track of all at once: analytics, dynamic forms data, UI and UX elements, and much more. This simple admin template is well suited for web apps or any other website or project that requires admin dashboard. This template will serve as a solid foundation for your upcoming project and will save you a lot of time and, hence, money.

## Quick Start

#### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version of Sing App Lite on your local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone -o sing-app-lite -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/flatlogic/sing-app.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
```

#### 2. Run `yarn install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file. We are moving all dependencies to npm, so there will be no bower dependencies soon.

#### 3. Run `yarn build`

This command will build the app from the source files (`/src`) into the output
`/dist` folder. Then open `dist/index.html` in your browser.

Now you can open your web app in a browser, on mobile devices and start
hacking. The page must be served from a web server, e.g. apache, nginx, WebStorm built-in web server, etc., otherwise some features may not work properly.

#### 3. Run `yarn watch`
This command will watch for changes in `/src` and recompile handlebars' templates & scss styles on the fly into html & css accordingly.
